            When yield is generated, it does not immediately get distributed to
            usersâ€™ wallets. It first goes through the Dripper, which releases
            the yield steadily over time. Raw yield is often generated at
            irregular intervals and in unpredictable amounts. The Dripper
            streams this yield gradually for a smoother and more predictable
            APY.

            Proof of Yield is shown as two distinct categories of information.
            Above, yield is measured from the perspective of an OETH holder
            after it leaves the Dripper. Below, yield from various sources is
            measured for the same time period prior to entering the Dripper.
