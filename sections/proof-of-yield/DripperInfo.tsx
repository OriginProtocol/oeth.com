        When yield is generated, it does not immediately get distributed to
        usersâ€™ wallets. It first goes through the Dripper, which releases the
        yield steadily over time. Raw yield is often generated at irregular
        intervals and in unpredictable amounts. The Dripper streams this yield
        gradually for a smoother and more predictable APY.

        leaves the Dripper. Below, yield from various sources is measured for
        the same time period prior to entering the Dripper.
